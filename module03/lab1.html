            <p>The Smallmouth Bass is a freshwater fish native to North America. These fish can be found in lakes and rivers throughout. Many fishermen target this species of fish because of their beautiful markings and because of their strength. These fish are strong making them <strong>extremely</strong> fun to fight when reeling them in.</p>
            <p>In the late spring these fish start their spawning season and become more agressive. This is the best time to go fishing for Smallmouth as they will attack pretty much anything that gets too close to their nest.</p>
